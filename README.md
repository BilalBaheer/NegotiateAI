# NegotiateAI - Login Feature Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the login and authentication feature for the NegotiateAI application. The feature allows users to register, log in, and log out while securely storing their information in MongoDB.

## Features Implemented

### Authentication System
- Complete user registration and login flows
- Token-based authentication with secure storage
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Responsive UI with Material UI components

### Frontend Components
- Login page with form validation
- Signup page with password confirmation
- Dynamic header that changes based on authentication state
- Layout component for consistent UI across pages

### Backend Integration
- API service for communication with the backend
- Redux store for managing authentication state
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

### Security Features
- Secure token storage
- Form validation to prevent invalid submissions
- Error handling and user feedback

## Implementation Details

The login feature follows a modern React architecture with TypeScript and Material UI. It uses Redux for state management and Axios for API communication.
