Your task is to analyze the negotiation text with the precision and insight of a master negotiator, providing comprehensive and actionable feedback.

Your analysis must include:

1. An overall effectiveness score from 0-100 based on these criteria:
   - Clarity and conciseness (15 points)
   - Persuasive language and rhetoric (15 points)
   - Professional tone and relationship building (15 points)
   - Strategic positioning and framing (15 points)
   - Addressing counterparty concerns and objections (15 points)
   - Effective use of negotiation techniques (15 points)
   - Clear call to action and next steps (10 points)
   
2. Tone analysis (assertive, passive, collaborative, etc.)
3. Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral)
4. Persuasive strength as a percentage from 0-100
5. Key strengths (3-5 specific points about what works well)
6. Areas for improvement (3-5 specific points about what could be better)
7. Specific tactical suggestions to make the text more effective (3-5 actionable points)
8. Negotiation frameworks identified in the text (BATNA, ZOPA, etc.)
9. Expert techniques used or missing (mirroring, labeling, etc.)
10. Power dynamics assessment (who appears to have leverage)
11. Negotiation phase identification (preparation, information exchange, bargaining, closing)

Apply the following expert negotiation principles in your analysis:
- Harvard Principled Negotiation Method (separate people from the problem, focus on interests not positions, invent options for mutual gain, insist on objective criteria)
- Chris Voss's tactical empathy and calibrated questions
- Robert Cialdini's principles of influence (reciprocity, commitment/consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity)
- Game theory concepts of information asymmetry and credible commitments
- Cultural sensitivity and awareness in international negotiations

Your task is to completely transform the following negotiation text into a masterpiece of persuasive communication that achieves optimal outcomes while maintaining relationship integrity.

Apply these advanced negotiation principles:

1. STRATEGIC FRAMING
   - Frame proposals in terms of the counterparty's interests and values
   - Use loss aversion by highlighting what they might miss rather than gain
   - Create a compelling narrative that makes your position seem inevitable

2. PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
   - Incorporate Cialdini's principles: reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity
   - Use strategic anchoring to set favorable expectations
   - Apply tactical empathy to demonstrate deep understanding

3. LINGUISTIC EXCELLENCE
   - Replace weak language with confident, authoritative phrasing
   - Use precise, concrete language instead of vague generalities
   - Employ rhetorical techniques (tricolon, anaphora, etc.) for memorability
   - Balance assertiveness with collaborative language

4. STRUCTURAL MASTERY
   - Open with a relationship-building statement that establishes common ground
   - Present your strongest points first and last (primacy-recency effect)
   - Include a clear, specific call to action with timeline
   - Anticipate and preemptively address potential objections

5. TACTICAL ELEMENTS
   - Incorporate subtle reciprocity triggers
   - Use strategic concessions to activate commitment/consistency
   - Include social proof elements relevant to the counterparty
   - Establish your authority and credibility naturally
   - Create appropriate scarcity or urgency without being manipulative

6. RELATIONSHIP BUILDING
   - Demonstrate genuine understanding of their position
   - Emphasize mutual benefits and long-term relationship value
   - Use "we" language to create a collaborative atmosphere
   - Acknowledge their expertise and contributions

The improved text must be substantially more effective while maintaining authenticity and ethical standards. It should represent the pinnacle of negotiation expertise applied to this specific situation.

ONLY return the improved text, with no additional commentary or explanations.`

Your task is to analyze the original negotiation text, create an improved version, and provide a comparative analysis between the two.

First, analyze the original text and assign it a score from 0-100 based on these criteria:
- Strategic framing (how well it frames proposals in terms of the counterparty's interests)
- Psychological triggers (use of reciprocity, commitment, social proof, etc.)
- Linguistic excellence (confident language, precise wording, rhetorical techniques)
- Structural mastery (opening, organization, call to action)
- Tactical elements (concessions, authority establishment, scarcity/urgency)
- Relationship building (mutual benefits, collaborative atmosphere)

Then, create a significantly improved version that addresses any weaknesses and enhances strengths.

IMPORTANT: The improved version MUST score at least 10-15 points higher than the original. If the original text is already strong (scoring 85+), still find ways to improve it by at least 5-10 points.

Finally, analyze the improved text using the same criteria and provide a comparative analysis.

Your response must be in the following JSON format:
{
  "originalAnalysis": {
    "score": <0-100>,
    "persuasiveStrength": <0-100>,
    "strengths": ["strength1", "strength2", ...],
    "weaknesses": ["weakness1", "weakness2", ...]
  },
  "improvedText": "<The complete improved negotiation text>",
  "improvedAnalysis": {
    "score": <0-100>,
    "persuasiveStrength": <0-100>,
    "strengths": ["strength1", "strength2", ...],
    "weaknesses": ["weakness1", "weakness2", ...]
  },
  "improvements": ["specific improvement 1", "specific improvement 2", ...],
  "addressedWeaknesses": ["addressed weakness 1", "addressed weakness 2", ...]
}

CRITICAL: You MUST ensure that the improved text scores significantly higher than the original. The improved score should be at least 10 points higher than the original score, unless the original is already above 85, in which case it should still be at least 5 points higher.`
